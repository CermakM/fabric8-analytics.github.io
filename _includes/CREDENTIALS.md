1) AWS Credentials


Head to the [AWS website](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and log in with your login details.
In the sub-menu on the left, go to the `Users` tab, click to your name there.
A new sub-window appears. The tab you are looking for is called `Security Credentials`.\
There you can create your Access Key ID, which we refer to in the environment files as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

To create an access key, choose `Create Access Key`. Then choose `Download Credentials` to save the access key ID and secret access key to a CSV file on your computer. Store the file in a secure location. **WARNING: You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes.**\
After you have downloaded the CSV file, choose `Close`.

For more information take a look at the [AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console).
