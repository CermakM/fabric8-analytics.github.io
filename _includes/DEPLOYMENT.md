# Deployment

## Core service

#### Local Deployment

Start by cloning or forking the [fabric8-analytics-deployement](https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-deployment). This repository should be everyting you need in order to run the core server API.

 You should check the README file, there should be all the information necessary for local deployment.

#### Deploying to OpenShift

 If you want to deploy it to the OpenShift, head over to the [openshift](https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-deployment/tree/master/openshift) folder in the repository and again take a quick look at the README there.

 There are scripts prepared to ease your job, feel free to use them.

 ## Stack Analyses - Kronos

 You might want to deploy stack analyses localy as well (although that's not what we typicaly do, since it requires some data in order to perform, OpenShift is a better solution ;))\
 In order to to that, you should clone the [fabric8-analytics-stack-analysis](https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-stack-analysis) repository.
